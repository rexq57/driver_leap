## Requirements:

1. Running requires
    * Ultraleap Tracking Software https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/

2. Building Samples requires
    * CMake 3.16.3+ (https://cmake.org/)
    * Microsoft Visual Studio 15+

## Installation:

1. Execute the LeapSDK installer.

2. Choose a suitable destination location on your computer.

3. Read and accept the Ultraleap Tracking SDK Agreement to use the Ultraleap SDK.

## Usage:

1. For CMake projects
    * Ensure LeapSDK is in a directory considered as a prefix by find_package.
        (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/find_package.html)
        * Or : directly set LeapSDK_DIR to <install_dir>/LeapSDK/lib/cmake/LeapSDK
        * Or : Pass the LeapSDK's path to find_package with the PATHS option.
    * call find_package(LeapSDK 5 [PATHS ...]).
    * call target_link_libraries(<your project> PUBLIC|PRIVATE LeapSDK::LeapC).
    * Ensure LeapC.dll is in your dynamic library search path.
        * A popular option is to add a post-build step that copies it to your project's output directory.

2. For non-CMake projects
    * Use a C/C++ compiler such as MSVC, Clang or GCC.
    * Add LeapSDK/include to the compiler include search paths.
    * Either add a linker reference to LeapC.lib or dynamically load LeapC.dll.

## Building Samples:

1. Open CMake using LeapSDK/samples as the source directory

2. Select a build directory (often LeapSDK/samples/build) to use

3. Configure & Generate CMake with the generator of your choice
    * An example script would be :
```powershell
$env:BUILD_TYPE = 'Release'
$env:REPOS_BUILD_ROOT = 'C:/build'
$env:REPOS_INSTALL_ROOT = 'C:/Program Files'

cmake -j -S "C:/Program Files/Ultraleap/LeapSDK/samples" -B $env:REPOS_BUILD_ROOT/$env:BUILD_TYPE/LeapSDK/leapc_example `
		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$env:REPOS_INSTALL_ROOT/leapc_example" `
		-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="$env:BUILD_TYPE"

cmake --build $env:REPOS_BUILD_ROOT/$env:BUILD_TYPE/LeapSDK/leapc_example -j --config $env:BUILD_TYPE
```

4. Open and build the CMake generated project files. For more help, see the CMake documentation.
